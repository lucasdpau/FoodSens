#FoodSens

FoodSens is a web app that lets you record your meals and any allergies/reactions that you experience. You can then use these records to identify the types of foods that trigger certain reactions, allergies, or flare-ups.

First create an account and log in, you don't want to get your meals and reactions confused with anyone elses!

You will be taken to the home page, where you see links to create reaction and/or food entries. You can click the calendar in the middle to make these entries easier.

Food entries also have tags. It is best to include the main ingredients or the meal as tags, while writing the name of the dish in the title.

In the settings, you can set how far back you want the app to analyze each reaction. I set a maximum of 14 days as it is unlikely that anything eaten long ago will cause an acute reaction.
