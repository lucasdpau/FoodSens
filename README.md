# FoodSens

FoodSens lets you correlate your meals and any allergies, reactions or flare-ups that you experience.

First create an account and log in, you don't want to get your meals and reactions confused with anyone elses!

You will be taken to the home page, where you see links to create reaction and/or food entries. You can click the calendar in the middle to make these entries easier.

Food entries also have tags. It is best to include the main ingredients or the meal as tags, while writing the name of the dish in the title.

In the settings, you can set how far back you want the app to analyze each reaction. I set a maximum of 14 days as it is unlikely that anything eaten long ago will cause an acute reaction.

### Development

I wanted to add a translucent image on the side of the login screen, but I wans't able to get it to work. One quick google search led me to css-tricks where an article was written about exactly what I wanted to do. I used a 'gradient' of two of the same color and I got the effect I wanted.
